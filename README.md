# Regression-Models-Course-Project
Final project for Coursera's Regression Models Course

## Scenario
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in finding out which type of transmission is better for MPG. You are tasked with conducting analysis on the data set and reporting your findings. 

## Instructions

Analyze the mtcars data set that is included with R and answer the following questions:

  1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

  2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.
